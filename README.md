# Art / Photo Poster

These scripts were created by Logan Maupin. I'm a student at the University of Arizona (Online) studying Applied Computing - Applied Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to one day create AI that can communicate & interface with humans and potentially detect threats or save humanity in some way. Specifically my field of choice is Natural Language Processing. If you don't know what I mean, check out GPT-3, IBM's Watson, or Gopher, as examples of what I am referring to in a way. 

This project has been a fun side hobby of mine after I made the Reddit Meme poster. I originally had the thought of, after I made the meme poster, what if we made a bot that instead of sharing memes it just shares absolutely beautiful landscapes / nature photos / art drawings that people made. My original idea was to make a sort of tattoo art page that shares beautiful tattoo pictures automatically, but the problem is that this is hard to moderate in FB because most tattoo pics are usually labeled as NSFW so I settled upon beautiful landscapes, nature, and scenary art.

Thanks for reading. If you have questions feel free to reach out to me and if you have any suggestions on how to improve the code, feel free to make those suggestions to me!
